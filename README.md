üî¢ These tables are an example of just **_SOME_** of the data we would like to record and store on our site 

## <a name='account-id'></a> Account Info

For WB Games we wanted to add customization to each users account. Key features we intend to include on launch are : 
1. Mark a main character you play
2. Customize PFP 
3. Change user info at will
4. Look up your stats

Though it may be small, we intend to add more in the future! ü§ù

## <a name='review-id'></a> Reviews

Each user will have the ability to log in and leave comments and reviews on each post made on the site.

This means new content will always allow users to leave their thoughts and suggestions as well.

`Wooohooo! Isn't that great?! üò≤`

**Indeed it is!**

This project is still in production _but_ feedback & suggestions are welcome!
